# changelogs-xyz ðŸ¦‹

Find npm changelogs, easily.

Inspired by and using [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/), originally conceived as 'unpkg for your changelogs'

Deployed to [changelogs.xyz](https://changelogs.xyz/)

Thanks to:

- [Mitchell Hamilton](https://github.com/mitchellhamilton/) for the inspiration
- [Noviny](https://github.com/noviny/) for initial implementation
- [Joss](https://github.com/jossmac/) for the design
- Thinkmill for supporting this

Future ideas:

- reverse the order changelogs are shown in
- make h2s more distinct, maybe try and highlight the actual version in it
